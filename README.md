<p>In this section, i will learn about two of C's most important program control statements: <b>if</b> and <b>for</b>. In general, program control statements determine your program's flow of execution. As such, they form the backbone of programs. In addition to these, i will also learn about blocks of code, the relational and logical operators, and more about the <b>printf()</b> function.</p><br>

  1. Become familiar with the if.<br>
     1.c --- 1. This program forms the basis for an addition drill. It displays two numbers and asks the user what the answer is. The program then tells the user if the answer is right or wrong.<br>
